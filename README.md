https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1244559576
This coding project is about an Early college program that goes to an aquarium as a field trip, but turns out it was a dream. Inside of it, you can see multiple sprites that goes into different background. There was use of loop, conditional statement, custom blocks, and other necessary blocks to make it function.
This project was done with the help of Ms. Amy, Mr. Joules, and somd other fellow beginner coders.
