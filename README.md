EC field trip to an aquarium
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1244559576
This coding project is about an Early college program that goes to an aquarium as a field trip, but turns out it was a dream. Inside of it, you can see multiple sprites that goes into different background. There was use of loop, conditional statement, custom blocks, and other necessary blocks to make it function.

The loop was in the Bus sprite which allowed it to keep on moving and to also switch onto the next background.

The conditional statement is there to allow another ending if a button is clicked, but due to some technical issues, it is not working.

There is at least 3 custom blocks who do different things to help the animation run smoothly.

This project was done with the help of Ms. Amy, Mr. Joules, and somd other fellow beginner coders.
